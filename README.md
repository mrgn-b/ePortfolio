## 📂 Projects 

### 1️⃣ [🚦 Embedded Traffic Light System](https://github.com/yourusername/embedded-traffic-light)  
**Description:** A simulated traffic light system using an STM32 microcontroller and Traffic Light Shield. The system synchronizes traffic and pedestrian lights using Finite State Machines (FSMs) and FreeRTOS for real-time multitasking. The project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure software reliability.  
**🛠 Tech Stack:** C, STM32CubeIDE, FreeRTOS, SPI, GPIO  

### 2️⃣ [🗺️ Graph-Based Map Application](https://github.com/yourusername/project-repo)  
**Description:** This Java-based application allows users to interact with a map by defining locations (nodes) and connections (edges) between them. Users can add, remove, and modify locations and connections, as well as find paths between locations. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX, enabling users to visualize the map and perform operations through an intuitive interface. The project is divided into two parts: a graph data structure (ListGraph) to manage the network of locations and connections, and a GUI that handles user interactions and visual representation.
**🛠 Tech Stack:** Java, JavaFX, Graph Theory, File I/O

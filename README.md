# üëã My GitHub Portfolio  
Hi my name is Morgan Bj√§lven√§s and welcome to my ePortfolio. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, showcasing my skills in programming and software development.

## üéì About Me
I'm currently a student studying Information and Communication Technology engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. My main programming languages are Java and C which is showcased in the attached projects.

## üìÇ Projects 

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [üö¶ Embedded Traffic Light System](https://github.com/mrgn-b/ePortfolio/tree/main/Projects/Embedded%20Traffic%20Light%20System/PRO1_Morgan_Bjalvenas)  
**Description:** A simulated traffic light system using an STM32 microcontroller and Traffic Light Shield. The system synchronizes traffic and pedestrian lights using Finite State Machines (FSMs) and FreeRTOS for real-time multitasking. The project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure software reliability.  
**üõ† Tech Stack:** C, STM32CubeIDE, FreeRTOS, SPI, GPIO  
**‚ùó Prerequisites:** STM32CubeIDE 1.13.2, FreeRTOS 10.3.1, STM32L476RGTx MCU, Traffic Light Shield

### How to Run the Software

1. **Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/mrgn-b/ePortfolio/tree/main/Projects/Embedded%20Traffic%20Light%20System/PRO1_Morgan_Bjalvenas).**
2. **Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.**
3. **Connect the STM32 microcontroller and Traffic Light Shield.**
4. **Build the project using the IDE's build tools.**
5. **Flash the binary to the STM32 microcontroller.**
6. **Run the system and observe the synchronized traffic and pedestrian light control.**

> ‚öôÔ∏è *Ensure that FreeRTOS is properly configured in STM32CubeIDE, and the correct SPI and GPIO settings are applied. For more details see project [report](https://github.com/mrgn-b/ePortfolio/blob/main/Projects/Embedded%20Traffic%20Light%20System/PRO1_report_Morgan_Bj%C3%A4lven%C3%A4s.pdf).*

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [üó∫Ô∏è Graph-Based Map Application](https://github.com/mrgn-b/ePortfolio/tree/main/Projects/Graph-Based%20Map%20Application/PROG2_Project_JavaFX)  
**Description:** This Java-based application allows users to interact with a map by defining locations (nodes) and connections (edges) between them. Users can add, remove, and modify locations and connections, as well as find paths between locations. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX, enabling users to visualize the map and perform operations through an intuitive interface. The project is divided into two parts: a graph data structure (ListGraph) to manage the network of locations and connections, and a GUI that handles user interactions and visual representation.  
**üõ† Tech Stack:** Java, JavaFX, Graph Theory, File I/O  
**‚ùó Prerequisites:** Java 17, JavaFX 20
